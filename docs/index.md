# Docs

This project is to make full Firebase bindings for Fuse.

Currently Authentication is implemented for the Email, Google & Facebook providers.

We hope to flesh this out to cover the full gammut of features provided by Firebase and would love to work with others to get this done.

- Authentication
    - [Getting up and running with the Example Project:](../src/Firebase.Authentication/Docs/Getting_up_and_running_with_the_Example_Project.md) A good place to get started
    - [JS API:](../src/Firebase.Authentication/Docs/JS_API.md) The Authentication API

- Notifications:
    - [The Push Notification Docs](../src/Firebase.Notifications.Android/Docs/Guide.md)
- Database
    - [API Reference](../src/Firebase.Database/Docs/reference.md)

Thanks to the amazing work of our contributors, analytics and ads are available too though they do not yet have documentation
