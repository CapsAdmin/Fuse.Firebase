# Docs

We hope to flesh this out to cover the full gammut of features provided by Firebase and would love to work with others to get this done.

- Authentication
    - [Auth Quick Start:](auth-quickstart.md) A good place to get started
    - [Auth API Reference:](auth.md) The Authentication API
- Notifications:
    - [The Push Notification Docs](push-notifications-android.md)
- Database
    - [Database API Reference](database.md)
- Storage
    - [Storage API Reference](storage.md)

Thanks to the amazing work of our contributors, analytics and ads are available too though they do not yet have documentation
