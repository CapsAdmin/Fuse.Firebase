This project is to make full Firebase bindings for Fuse.

Currently Authentication is implemented for the Email, Google & Facebook providers.

We hope to flesh this out to cover the full gammut of features provided by Firebase and would love to work with others to get this done.

- Authentication
 - [JS API](../src/Firebase.Authentication/Docs/JS_API.md)
 - [Getting up and running with the Example Project](../src/Firebase.Authentication/Docs/Getting_up_and_running_with_the_Example_Project.md)

- [Notifications](../src/Firebase.Notifications.Android/Docs/Guide.md)

Thanks to the amazing work of our contributors, analytics and ads are available too though they do not yet have documentation
