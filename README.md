# Fuse.Firebase

This project is to make full Firebase bindings for Fuse.

Currently Authentication is implemented for the Email, Google & Facebook providers.

I would love to flesh this out to cover the full gammut of features provided by Firebase and would love to work with others to get this done.

## Docs

See the [wiki]() for [API Docs]() and the [guide for getting the authentication example running]().

## Requirements

- Fuse version >= 25: This is needed as a bunch of changes shipped in that version to make this all possible including appcompat7 Activity as super class for the app's activity
- Firebase account

For authentication you also need a Facebook developer account
